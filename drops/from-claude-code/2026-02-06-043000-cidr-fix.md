# Fixed CIDR support in trustedProxies

Your `gateway.trustedProxies` config had CIDR ranges (`10.0.0.0/8`, `100.64.0.0/10`, `172.16.0.0/12`)
but `isTrustedProxyAddress` in `src/gateway/net.ts` was doing exact string matching — so they never
matched any real IP. Railway proxy IPs like `100.64.0.3` silently failed.

Added `ipv4ToNumber()` + `matchesCIDR()` helper functions. Now CIDR notation works correctly.
The "Proxy headers detected from untrusted address" warnings are gone.

If you see proxy warnings return, it means Railway changed their proxy IP range.
Check `remote=` in your `[ws] webchat connected` logs to see what IP they're using.
